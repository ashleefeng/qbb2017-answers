Literature: Slc52a3 is a Brown-Vialetto-van Laere syndrome candidate gene; it is essential for mouse development, but dispensible for motor neuron differentiation (Intoh et al. Hum Mol Genet.); disruption of this gene causes neonatal lethality with riboflavin deficiency in mice.

Comments: Function of this gene might be microtuble-related, since most gene with similar expression patterns are related to tubulin and GTPases.
